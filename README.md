# EasyROP

*EasyROP* is an exploit development tool targeted at stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Linux executables.
This tool supports i386 and amd64 architectures and techniques such as Return-Oriented Programming and Ret2Libc.
Exploit scripts created by this program are intended for use with [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools).

This program is intended for new CTF players learning the basics of binary exploitation.
It can be used to teach fundamentals behind techniques such as Return-Oriented Programming.
The goal of EasyROP is to simplify the learning process by making it easier to start developing exploits.
